Welcome Anastasiya McAvoy,

## Code Institute - Milestone project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development
## Anastasiya's nail salon

### About
Anastasiyaâ€™s Nail Salon is a newly established, independent business that stands to greatly benefit from a robust online presence. A well-designed website will not only enhance visibility but also provide a platform to showcase a curated gallery of stunning nail art, as well as a comprehensive list of services offered. The inclusion of an intuitive enquiry form will make it easy for both new and existing customers to get in touch, whether for inquiries or bookings. The website has been crafted with an elegant and subtle aesthetic, ensuring a sophisticated yet welcoming atmosphere. User experience has been a key focus, with an emphasis on seamless navigation to ensure that visitors feel invited and engaged from the moment they land on the site.

### Typography
After conducting extensive research on typography trends within the beauty industry, I've carefully selected Montserrat, a modern and versatile font, as the primary typeface for this project. Montserrat is widely used in the beauty sector due to its clean lines, professional appeal, and excellent legibility across both digital and print media. This font will be imported directly from Google Fonts to ensure optimal performance and seamless integration into the design, providing a sophisticated yet approachable aesthetic for the brand.  

### Colour Scheme  
The color scheme has been thoughtfully chosen to enhance the salon's elegant aesthetic while creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Soft, neutral tones such as creamy beige, dusty blue, and subtle gray have been selected to evoke a sense of luxury and sophistication, while maintaining a welcoming and approachable vibe. This balanced palette not only complements the salon's branding but also helps to create a calm and relaxing environment for visitors, encouraging them to explore the site and book services with ease. The colors work harmoniously together, adding to the overall refined and professional look of the website as well as meeting AAA acessibbility standards.

## Features:
This site features 4 pages, home, gallery and book now and a success page. All pages feature responsive design, a navbar and footer

*Cause*: Sapcing issues as content is different size but padding only looks good on big screen.  
*Solution*: applying card sizes for different screens.
